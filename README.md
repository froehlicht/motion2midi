## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Installation

1. **Download** Motion2MIDI from [Releases](https://github.com/froehlicht/motion2midi/releases/latest)
2. **Unzip** the downloaded file
3. **Copy plugins to your plugin folder**:
    - **AU:** `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/Motion2MIDI.component`
    - **VST3:** `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/Motion2MIDI.vst3`
4. **Restart your DAW**

### 2. Setup IAC Driver (macOS)

The IAC Driver creates a virtual MIDI bus for routing MIDI between applications.

#### How to activate the IAC Driver:

1. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities → Audio MIDI Setup)
2. Go to **Window → Show MIDI Studio** (or press ⌘2)
3. Double-click the **IAC Driver** icon
4. Check **"Device is online"**

### 3. DAW Setup

#### In your DAW's MIDI Settings:

Enable the IAC Driver for MIDI input/output:

**Ableton Live:**

- Go to **Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI**
- Under **MIDI Ports**, enable:
    - **Track** (for IAC Driver) ✓
    - **Remote** (for IAC Driver) ✓

![Ableton MIDI Settings](media/ableton-midi-settings.png)

**FL Studio:**

- Go to **Options → MIDI Settings**
- Enable the IAC Driver in the input list
- Set **"Enable"** to ON

### 4. Load Motion2MIDI

1. **Load Motion2MIDI** 
2. **Select MIDI output** in the plugin → Choose **"IAC Driver Bus 1"**
3. **Grant camera permission** when prompted (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera)

### 5. MIDI Mapping

Motion2MIDI sends 4 MIDI CC parameters:

|Parameter|Default CC|Controls|
|---|---|---|
|LX|CC 11|Left hand horizontal position|
|LY|CC 12|Left hand vertical position|
|RX|CC 13|Right hand horizontal position|
|RY|CC 14|Right hand vertical position|

You can change the CC numbers using the **Learn** function.

## 🎛️ MIDI Mapping in Your DAW

### Ableton Live

1. **Enable MIDI Map Mode**:
    
    - Press **⌘M** (macOS) or **Ctrl+M** (Windows)
    - Or click the **MIDI** button in the top-right corner
2. **Select the parameter** you want to control in Ableton (e.g., filter cutoff, volume)
    
3. **In Motion2MIDI**: Click the **Map** button for the desired parameter (LX, LY, RX, or RY)
    
    - The plugin automatically sends a test MIDI signal
    - The parameter in Ableton will highlight and the mapping is established
4. **Deactivate Map** before selecting the next parameter, or the parameter will also be mapped to the current movement axis
    
5. **Exit MIDI Map Mode**: Press **⌘M** again
    

**Note:** Motion2MIDI automatically activates "No MIDI Singal Generation" during mapping to prevent unwanted parameter movements.

### FL Studio

1. **In Motion2MIDI**: Click the **Map** button for the desired parameter (LX, LY, RX, or RY)
    
    - The plugin sends constant MIDI signals with value 64 for linking
2. **In FL Studio**: Move the parameter you want to control (e.g., a knob or fader)
    
3. **Link the controller**:
    
    - Right-click the parameter
    - Select **Link to controller**
    - Or use: **Tools → Last tweaked → Link to controller**
4. **The connection is established**
    

**Note:** Motion2MIDI automatically activates "No Processing Mode" during mapping to prevent unwanted parameter movements.

### Other DAWs

> **TODO:** Mapping strategies for Logic Pro, Reaper, GarageBand, and other DAWs coming soon.
> 
> Most DAWs support standard MIDI Learn functionality. The general process is:
> 
> 1. Activate MIDI Learn in your DAW
> 2. Click the parameter you want to control
> 3. Click the **MAP** button in Motion2MIDI
> 4. Deactivate the MAP button before selecting the next parameter in your DAW
> 
> If you've successfully mapped Motion2MIDI in another DAW, please [share your workflow](https://github.com/froehlicht/motion2midi/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) to help other users!

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Camera Setup

- **Lighting matters** - Ensure your hands are well-lit for best tracking
- **Camera angle** - Position camera to capture your hands clearly
- **Background** - Avoid cluttered backgrounds for better detection

### Control Zones

- Red dots show the tracked hand positions used for MIDI
- These control points are always visible and drive the MIDI output

### Workflow Tips

- **Solo mode** - Use solo buttons to focus on one parameter at a time
- **Mute** - Temporarily disable a parameter without losing its mapping
- **No Processing Mode** - Stops MIDI output (useful during setup)
- **Settings** - Click the **Settings** button for visualization options
